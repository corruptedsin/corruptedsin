I WAS MISINFORMED ABOUT THIS PERSON. I DO NOT WHATSOEVER SUPPORT WHAT THEY DO AND DO NOT ASSOCIATE MYSELF AROUND THEM ANYMORE.







ᶻ 𝗓 𐰁 .ᐟ - i have social anxiety. so please be patient with me if i struggle to talk or do something. i always act out what i do before i do it, i am trying to get better with talking to people, i'm sorry if im awkward or make you feel uncomfortable, i advise u dni if u dont like how i act.  i get upset over small things easily and tend to isolate from others if so.


𖤝

⭑𓂃 - i am usually offtab playing something; i enjoy playing dead by daylight, rdr2, resident evil, the legend of zelda
